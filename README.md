<h1> Important Keywords <h1>
  <hr>
Keywords refer to the reserved set of words of a language. These are used for some predefined actions.

1.abstract: It is a non-access modifier applicable for classes and methods. It is used to achieve abstraction. For more, refer to abstract keyword in java
  
  
2.enum: It is used to define enum in Java
  
3.instanceof: It is used to know whether the object is an instance of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).
  
4.private: It is an access modifier. Anything declared private cannot be seen outside of its class.
  
5.protected: If you want to allow an element to be seen outside your current package, but only to classes that subclass your class directly, then declare that element protected.
  
6.public: Anything declared public can be accessed from anywhere. For more on Access Modifiers, refer to Access Modifiers in Java 
  
7.static: It is used to create a member(block, method, variable, nested classes) that can be used by itself, without reference to a specific instance. For more, refer static keyword in java
  
8.strictfp: It is used for restricting floating-point calculations and ensuring the same result on every platform while performing operations in the floating-point variable.
  
9.synchronized: Applicable for blocks methods. It is used to get synchronization in java. For more, refer to Synchronized in Java
  
10.transient: transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization, if we donâ€™t want to save the value of a particular variable in a file, then we use the transient keyword. 
  
11.volatile: The volatile modifier tells the compiler that the variable modified by volatile can be changed unexpectedly by other parts of your program. For more, refer to volatile keyword in java
