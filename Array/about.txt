Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.

Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index and so on.

In Java, array is an object of a dynamically generated class. Java array inherits the Object class, and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces.

We can store primitive values or objects in an array in Java.


Advantages--

Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.
Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.


Disadvantages--

Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.



There are two types of array.

Single Dimensional Array -  a[]

Multidimensional Array a[][] or a[][][]
