Shutdown Hooks are a special construct that allows developers to plug in a piece of code to be executed when the JVM is shutting down. This comes in handy in cases where we need to do special clean up operations in case the VM is shutting down.

public class ShutDownHook
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {

    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread()
    {
      public void run()
      {
        System.out.println("Shutdown Hook is running !");
      }
    });
    System.out.println("Application Terminating ...");
  }
}

A Java class file is a file containing Java bytecode and having .class extension that can be executed by JVM.
