It represents the unordered set of elements which doesn't allow us to store the duplicate items.

We can store at most one null value in Set. 

Set is implemented by HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

Set<data-type> s1 = new HashSet<data-type>();  
Set<data-type> s2 = new LinkedHashSet<data-type>();  
Set<data-type> s3 = new TreeSet<data-type>();  

HashSet class implements Set Interface. 
It represents the collection that uses a hash table for storage. Hashing is used to store the elements in the HashSet. It contains unique items.
